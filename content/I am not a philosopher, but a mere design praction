I am not a philosopher, but a mere design practioner.
We are looking for ways of thinking about the system.
Now, we have identified that there is little to work with in the scope of control.
So we have to 

Attention Scaffolding
- Procsses and artifacts used to [...] trigger cognitive states
--> is this true for social media?
--> is trigger with intention? or is the cognitive state just a intermediary state?

Social media as "hostile attentional scaffolds"
- Should we think of social media differently?
- Can we think of social media as both useful and hostile?

# Statement: So, algorithms are not made, per se, to keep users hooked or to make them addicted; they only look for patterns in data to maximize engagement.
- are the emotional lock-in features a mere proxy towards attention
- is the maximization of attention an ethical domain
- 
# Statement: But there are worries that for a lot of users, it is very hard to exercise self-control when on social media platforms

# Statement: Design for disengagment?


Epistemic agency
- From our interviews, we learn that young people act against their better judgement. They know they engage in an addicting act...
What do you think is the barrier between knowing and acting?

# Statement: in your paper you identify 2 mechanisms:
1. The curation content: feeds of addictive content - optimized for retention
2. Social validation (likes / shares) to keep engaged

I would argue that these 2 are untangled in modern day apps, catering for the users 1 and for the creators 2
It's like there are 2 audiences: creators and users. 

Can you elaborate a bit on the "triangle of distraction?"


Contagion is a key mechanism that you mention
- Can you image a way to leverage contagion to change?


However, there is a lack of incentives for social media platforms to alter their very effective profit-generating business models, in lack of direct regulation forcing them to. Consequently, the onus falls on users to be more mindful of how they use social media. To regain control over their digital lives, users should understand how these platforms operate and generate profits, which points towards the fact that there is a need to educate them about how these platforms work. Digital literacy programs should start as soon as possible, especially for current and future generations of digital native for whom social media platforms are a normal part of their lives.
